# Distans

This is a website I created during distance education (COVID flashbacks 😵‍💫). We had a rotation of two groups based on surnames (A-K and L-Ö). This website used the school API to check which class that had
physical education that day. It was written in like 1,5 hours on a distance education afternoon.

## Installation

* Add `jquery.fittext.js` (see [FitText](http://fittextjs.com/)) and `flowtype.js` (see [Flowtype](https://simplefocus.com/flowtype)) in the root directory.
